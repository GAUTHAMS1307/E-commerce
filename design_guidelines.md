# Vibe Commerce Shopping Cart - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Reference-Based Design:** Drawing inspiration from modern e-commerce leaders (Shopify, Etsy, Amazon) with emphasis on clean product presentation, frictionless cart experience, and trust-building checkout flow. This application prioritizes visual appeal and seamless shopping experience that drives conversion.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Product-First Experience:** Product imagery and pricing are hero elements
2. **Trust & Clarity:** Clear pricing, obvious cart actions, transparent totals
3. **Minimal Friction:** One-click add to cart, instant feedback, streamlined checkout
4. **Visual Hierarchy:** Guide users from browse → cart → checkout naturally
